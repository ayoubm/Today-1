This app shows some information about what happened today (who born or died and a special event).
I have used [this](https://history.muffinlabs.com/) API in this app.
And I have used animation which I created in [Flare](https://rive.app/a/mechashadow/files/flare/today/preview).
Feel free to edit the code and learn from it.
